# DEVCLUB-ASSIGNMENT-PART-2
# YALE SCHOOL OF ART


## This is an Adobe XD UI redesign for the website https://www.art.yale.edu which is a website for the Yale School Of Art
## I redesigned this website due to its old fashioned  and messed up design, not following any material UI guidelines at all.

### Shown below is a flow chart of the Adobe XD file. 
### The starting point of the file is the top most page enclosed in a rectangle.
