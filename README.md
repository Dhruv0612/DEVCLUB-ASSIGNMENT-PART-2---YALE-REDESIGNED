# DEVCLUB-ASSIGNMENT-PART-2
# YALE SCHOOL OF ART


## This is an Adobe XD UI redesign for the website https://www.art.yale.edu which is a website for the Yale School Of Art
## I redesigned this website due to its old fashioned  and messed up design, not following any material UI guidelines at all.

### Shown below is a flow chart of the Adobe XD file. 
### The starting point of the file is the top most page enclosed in a rectangle.

### Shown below is the home page, where the YALE icon has a beautiful changing background with each page swap. The home page also has a menu on the top-right corner to navigate through the website. Also present, is a quick links option on the right edge of the window.

### Next comes the Apply to college page. This page further has 3 links, about admissions and financing your education.

### Moving on, we see the exhibitions page which has a piece of art on exhibition, along with the available time slots for posting up your art on the exhibition page.

### No website is complete without a Visitor Login page. The Visitor Login landing page is for people who don't have a Yale NetID. If anyone has a Yale NetID,  they are supposed to click on "Click Here" which takes them to another page for users who have a present Yale NetID. Users can move back and forth between these two login pages.
